         What do you understand by <strong>JavaScript?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
             A Definition of the JS Programming Language
            JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.
        </p>
          <p> Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.</p> 
        
          <h2>What is difference between Java and JavaScript?</h2>
         
          <p>
            According to the Java platform official website, the main difference between Java and JavaScript is that Java is an OOP programming language while JavaScript is an OOP programming script. JavaScript code is written completely in text and need only be interpreted. Java, on the other hand, must be compiled.
          </p>

          <h2>vanilla JS</h2>
          <p>
            Vanilla JavaScript refers to using plain Javascript without any additional libraries or frameworks. The term became popular when Eric Wastl created the Vanilla JS site in 2012 as a joke. The site tries to bring attention to the fact that you can use just plain Javascript in many cases.</p>
            <p>
                

"VanillaJS is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery back in the days. People use it as a joke to remind other developers that many things can be done nowadays without the need for additional JavaScript libraries."
            </p>
